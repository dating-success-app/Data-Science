ok, let\\'s break down\\nall those different facet things.<br />\\n<br />\\na) intellectual/philosophical/political. this is where i live. i am\\na libertarian socialist, notice which is the root, but to me each\\nterm is a bit more generic than is generally understood. simply\\nput, everyone\\'s basic need should be guaranteed (yes, regardless of\\nanything), following which the government should be efficient,\\ntransparent, and laissez-faire. or to put it another way, do your\\njob then leave me alone. only a meritocracy of intellectuals has\\nthe capacity to be a proper leadership for the world, so take your\\nobjections to intellectual oligarchy and shove \\'em where the sun\\ndon\\'t shine. democracy is an evil. rule by might, not right.\\nwhoever has the biggest opinion gets their way instead of whoever\\nhas the best opinion. not only that but there will always be some\\nsmall minority which is completely disenfranchised just because\\nthey happen to never be in the majority. how can any government be\\nvalid when someone whose opinions are just as likely right as\\nanyone else\\'s never gets their way? that\\'s another thing, all\\nopinions are not equal. one is better than another based on how\\nwell it meshes with objective reality. and yes, there is an\\nobjective reality, or at least if there isn\\'t there\\'s nothing else\\nto talk about, particularly ethics, politics, or philosophy.\\nbacking up... although you have every right to your basic survival\\nas a default just from having been born (because we\\'re not animals\\nand that sort of naturalism is directly contrary to our societal\\nevolution and individual sentient autonomy) you can lose that. life\\nhas no inherent value. that value must be added. the default is\\nonly a baseline. if you try to do good things, don\\'t take more than\\nyour share, and generally make the world a better place, you\\ndeserve all life has to offer. if you don\\'t, you shouldn\\'t be on\\nthis planet taking up space and resources needed by those who are,\\nyou are a weed which needs to be plucked. if you don\\'t know what\\ni\\'m talking about, start with \"i think, therefore i am\" and \"know\\nthyself\" and i\\'ll meet you on the other side.<br />\\n<br />\\nb) geek/dweeb/nerd. i don\\'t lay equal claim on those but until the\\ntechnical social pariah crowd gets together to determine their\\nactual definitions i\\'ll just hedge my bets. i\\'m not as into\\nmanga/comics etc as most of this ilk, i\\'m not as into anything i\\nguess as most people who lay claim to these monikers but as in most\\nother aspects of my life i am a generalist. i know a little bit\\nabout it all, not much about anything. i appreciate all of it.\\ndespite having been interested in some aspect or another my whole\\nlife it\\'s never been my scene so maybe i\\'m just a legacy now\\nwithout ever having graduated. or maybe i just fit in because i\\'m\\nan outcast, lol.<br />\\n<br />\\nc) bohemian/hippie. to me this says coffee shop culture. but then\\nthat\\'s so varied isn\\'t it. in pulp fiction they call something like\\na denny\\'s a coffee shop. i never would. the shop that they hang out\\nin in friends seems to qualify (barely) but the conversation is\\nmundane. it should be profound, arcane, or sublime. where\\'s the\\nart? where\\'re the deep nooks for intimate connection and\\nreflection? philosophy lives there, it\\'s the new forum. rainbow\\ngatherings are planned, as are gunpowder plots. constitutions and\\nmanifestos are written, personalities meld and shatter, words flow\\nand drip oozing from psychic pores. yes, poetry is written too,\\nlines are drawn, souls collide. whatever. it\\'s the hive of the\\nmind.<br />\\n<br />\\nd) goth/freak. i\\'m an original vicgoth. if you don\\'t know what that\\nmeans, well, you\\'re probably not a goth, you\\'re a poseur. being\\ngoth isn\\'t about the music, it\\'s about joyous melancholy. whatever\\nmusic helps you reach that place is suitable. and goth is not emo,\\nalthough it used to be far closer. above all, goth is not heavy\\nmetal and hot topic. those are tools, they are not representative\\nof the whole and they are not the deep focused angst of a true\\ngoth, however much cutting you do there. --as a freak generally,\\nfreaks generally are my people. i embrace the pariah, i love the\\nculturally downtrodden. i am part of the out crowd and i love it\\nthere. my opinions are incompatible with the status quo, and aside\\nfrom philosophy, in which i am a god and the normals are sheep, our\\nthoughts and opinions are what maintain diversity and prevent the\\ngrey nation syndrome. we are those for whom the constitution was\\nwritten to protect. we are those for whom freedom of speech is the\\nprimary enabler, not a nice side-effect. freaks are the joy and\\nwonder of the world. we\\'re here, we\\'re queer, get used to it.'],\n",
